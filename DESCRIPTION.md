DragonToast replaces the default loot scroll with a sleek, animated toast feed that keeps you informed without cluttering your screen.

- Animated toast notifications for items, gold, currency, quest items, and XP gains
- Quality-colored item names with configurable minimum quality filter
- Duplicate stacking (x2, x3…) and consecutive XP aggregation
- Smooth entrance, pop, and exit animations with configurable hold duration
- Combat deferral — toasts queue during combat and flush when combat ends
- Shift-click to link items in chat, hover for full tooltip
- Full LibSharedMedia-3.0 support for fonts, textures, and sounds
- Minimap icon with quick-access controls

Supports **TBC Anniversary** and **Retail** WoW versions.

Use `/dt config` to open the settings panel and customize filters, appearance, growth direction, max visible toasts, and more. Every display element — icon, item level, type, looter name, quantity — can be toggled independently.

DragonToast automatically detects ElvUI and matches its fonts, statusbar textures, and border colors for a seamless UI experience.
